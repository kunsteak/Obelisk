# PCB
I used [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com) for this project with all options set to default except for:
* PCB color: Black
* Surface Finish: LeadFree HASL

Total cost: 11.86$ (5x PCB + basic shipping)

## IMPORTANT INFO!!!
* MCU component side faces up away from the board on both sides (reversible footprint). Mind the rectangular pin on the PCB and MCU!
* If you want to use the puck from [splitkb.com](https://splitkb.com/products/tenting-puck) you'll have to sand down one of the legs to about 1mm. The three legs that are left are more than enough to hold the keyboard firmly (as is the case for most other boards). Even two are enough!
* When connecting the JST connector make sure that the ground/black wire of the battery is on the left, for the right half, and on the right, for the left half of the keyboard. See main page README for right half picture.

##  Parts list:
* 2x JST connectors male & female ([AliExpress](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrW9HoI))
* 2x battery 
* splitkb.com:
	* 2x nice!nano v2 (tip: socket it)
	* 2x power switch
	* 18x choc v1 switches
	* kailh choc hotswaps
	* 18x keycaps (choc)
	* 2x tenting puck (optional)
	* 2x reset button (optional: short pads with tweezers instead)

I tried to only use parts that could be ordered from a single vendor but the JST connector from splitkb was just to big for my liking.
